####  AQFP is great, but why. 

Superconducting digital circuits have had a wild ride, full of twists, turns, and the occasional heartbreak—like a soap opera, but for physicists. The story begins in 1962, when Brian Josephson, a physics grad student at Cambridge, predicted the **Josephson Junction** [1]. Spoiler alert: he was right, and it earned him a Nobel Prize. This tiny quantum device, capable of switching at absurd speeds with near-zero energy loss, became the foundation of superconducting logic.

####  Meanwhile, in the Land of Silicon...

While superconducting computing was finding its feet, another drama was unfolding in the world of semiconductor electronics. Enter **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)**—the scrappy underdog that turned into the undisputed heavyweight champion of digital logic. By the late 1970s, CMOS had wrestled dominance away from NMOS thanks to its lower power consumption, reduced heat generation, better noise margins, enhanced scalability, and lower costs in the long term... and by the 1980s, it had pretty much taken over the entire semiconductor industry.

IBM took a shot at superconducting logic with its **Josephson Supercomputer Program** in the late 1960s. The idea? Outrun silicon. The problem? Scalability and robustness were major headaches, and by 1983, IBM had pulled the plug [2]. CMOS, with its ever-shrinking transistors and relentless efficiency gains, was like that overachieving classmate who always seemed to have their life together.

#### The RSFQ Renaissance

Superconducting computing wasn’t down for the count, though. In 1985, **K. Likharev** and colleagues proposed **Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ)** circuits [3]. These little wonders could operate at ultra-high speeds with femtojoule-level energy dissipation—way lower than CMOS. But there was a catch: power dissipation. RSFQ required resistors to maintain its state, meaning it guzzled power like a sports car stuck in traffic.

At the same time, **Eiichi Goto**—yes, the same Goto behind the parametron—proposed **Quantum Flux Parametron (QFP)** in 1986 [4]. The idea was to eliminate those pesky resistors and use purely inductive elements, making things even more energy efficient. Cool, but still not quite ready for prime time.

#### Enter AQFP: The Supercool Contender

By the 2010s, the need for energy-efficient computing was more urgent than ever. Enter **Nobuyuki Yoshikawa** from Yokohama National University, who, in 2011, proposed **Adiabatic Quantum Flux Parametron (AQFP)** [5]. AQFP took the best of QFP and added **adiabatic switching**, meaning it could recycle energy and sip power like a zen master of efficiency.

Compared to RSFQ, AQFP doesn’t waste energy in resistors—it keeps things nice and smooth, like superconducting Tai Chi. With AQFP, superconducting logic finally had an answer to CMOS in terms of energy efficiency. This made AQFP a prime candidate for **low-power, high-performance computing**, especially in areas where classical electronics struggles—like neuromorphic and quantum computing.

#### The Future: Superconductors Strike Back? 

With the rise of **neuromorphic computing**, **AI**, and **quantum computing**, superconducting digital circuits—especially AQFP—are making a comeback. Initiatives like the **IARPA SuperTools** project (launched in 2017) have fueled research into these futuristic circuits [6]. As CMOS starts hitting the limits of miniaturization and power efficiency, superconducting logic could be waiting in the wings for its big moment. 

Will AQFP and superconducting logic take over the world? Maybe. Maybe not. But one thing’s for sure—it’s got the potential to give CMOS a serious run for its money. And hey, at the very least, it’s a lot cooler. Literally.
