### Superconducting Electronics: Where Quantum Meets Circuits

#### 3.1 Josephson Junction (JJ): The MVP of Superconducting Logic

If transistors are the heart of CMOS circuits, then **Josephson Junctions (JJs)** are the superheroes of superconducting logic. A JJ is just a thin insulating barrier sandwiched between two superconductors - we call it sandwich strucutre, but this tiny device enables **quantum tunneling**, **zero-voltage switching**, and speeds that make conventional transistors look sluggish.

Why does this matter? Because JJs switch with almost **zero energy dissipation**â€”perfect for low-power, high-speed computing. But wait, there's more!

#### 3.2 SQUID: Not the Ocean Creature, but Equally Cool

Enter the **Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)**, which sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie (and honestly, it kind of is). SQUIDs use two JJs in a loop to detect minute magnetic fields with insane sensitivity. Think of it as a superpowered magnetometer that physicists and engineers drool over.

Why do we care? Because SQUIDs help stabilize and amplify superconducting signals, a crucial function in circuits like **AQFP**.
