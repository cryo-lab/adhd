### Superconductors: The Coolest Materials Ever

Imagine a world where electricity flows without resistance, like a perfect highway with zero traffic. Welcome to the world of **superconductors**. These materials, when cooled below a critical temperature (which is really, really cold), exhibit **zero electrical resistance** and **perfect diamagnetism** (they can levitate magnets like a magic trick). 

You might be thinking, “Why haven’t we replaced all wires with superconductors?” The answer: **liquid helium is expensive**, and room-temperature superconductors are still in the *“wishful thinking”* phase. For decades, scientists have been chasing this dream, sometimes a little *too* desperately—let’s just say a few may have bent the rules of science (and ethics) along the way.

### The Great Room-Temperature Superconductor Fiascos

#### Ranga Dias and the Vanishing Superconductor

In 2020, **Ranga Dias**, a researcher at the University of Rochester, claimed to have discovered the first-ever room-temperature superconductor, publishing the results in *Nature*. The scientific community was thrilled—until people started scrutinizing the data. Accusations of manipulation and academic misconduct followed, and the paper was **retracted**. Dias later lost access to his lab and university position. Oops. ([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00716-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### LK-99: Korea’s Hype Train

In 2023, a group of Korean scientists announced that they had synthesized **LK-99**, a material supposedly superconducting at room temperature and ambient pressure. The internet went wild. Researchers worldwide scrambled to replicate the results, only to find... it wasn’t actually a superconductor. Another promising claim, another **scientific faceplant**.

#### The India IISc Saga

Back in 2018, researchers at the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** reported room-temperature superconductivity in gold-silver nanostructures. However, their findings had weirdly consistent noise patterns in the data—so consistent that skeptics raised eyebrows. Though they repeated their experiments in 2019, the claim remains **controversial at best**. ([Source](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-superconductor-scandal-scientists-question-a-nobel-prize-worthy-claim/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

These cases remind us that in the thrilling world of superconductors, **extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence**—or at the very least, **reproducible experiments**.
